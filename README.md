# Hackathon

### CosmicGist
This is a website that allows you to upload a URL and returns a summary version of the uploaded webpage. The front end was created with React, the back end with Flask, and the text summarization with gpt-3.5 API. There is a user history function as well that locally tracks the last inputs and displays them.
